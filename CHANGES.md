***

## [3.0.0] - 2020-12-25

### Added

+ Anti Challenge Collapsar now supports IPV6 ([00fbc1c](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/00fbc1c20ec964f6cd3bb992d756737e95b6c7ed)).

+ IP black and white lists support IPV6, and can recognize IPV6 strings such as `fe80::/10` ([8519b26](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/8519b26f5fb9491ac60ae084247a0957c0931d0c)).

### Changed

+ Delete some meaningless logs ([bd279e7](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/bd279e7be872621fa75337722a9fae30b2ea6812)).

+ Friendly error alerts ([d1185b2](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/d1185b26a413e45dcf5ef479b0078aa57a4b5962) & [f2b617d](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/f2b617d5174eb1bc6982113415ddcb1f798ef703)). Warnings or error reporting when IP addresses in the rule file are invalid or IP address blocks overlap (does not detect all overlaps).

+ Faster IP matching ([2b9e774](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/2b9e77404826666df301c3d6b3ce07a6968de266)).

### Fixed

+ Fixed a bug that caused the cookie inspection not work ([87beed1](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/87beed183e404c70411a2d35ea68ebbccccf5ff6)).

+ Modify the `config` file to ensure that the latest module code is compiled when executing `make` or `make modules` ([25f97f5](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/25f97f5e7f3792b131ab0ebb1bfe4b7fe5e330ae)). Before the fix, if only the files under `inc/` changed, the latest code would not be compiled because the files under `inc/` were not checked for changes.

+ Fixed a bug with incorrect IPV4 segment identification ([73a22eb](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/73a22eb3538a24e9714bf8331946a5654df20cc1)). This bug could cause the subnet mask not to be generated correctly when a rule like `192.168.0.0/10`, i.e. the suffix is not a multiple of 8, appears in the rule.

***

## [2.0.0] - 2020-09-29

### Added

+ We can compile the module with `--add-dynamic-module`. Thanks for [dvershinin](https://github.com/dvershinin)'s work([https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/pull/4](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/pull/4))。

### Changed

+ Remove a default User-Agent rule that is `(?i)(? :Sogou web spider)`, as it will block non-malicious web spider([827d4e5](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/827d4e5bc48894ff9147e49799d3a9656fe7dd8a)).

+ Merge directives ([ba92cfd](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/ba92cfd53ce78da8ff4ed22d2bc71a47de4cbe25)). These directives will be merged: `waf_check_ipv4`, `waf_check_url`, `waf_check_args`, `waf_check_ua`, `waf_check_referer`, `waf_check_cookie`, `waf_check_post`, `waf_check_cookie`, `waf_cc_deny`. The merged new directive is `waf_mode`, see [README](README-EN.md).

### Fixed

+ The blank lines in the rules can now be read correctly ([955cf2d](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/955cf2d240c4d66f815890e3ee9b88ccf906cf1d)).
