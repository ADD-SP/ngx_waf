## Install

On Unix Like

### download the source code of nginx

If you want to add a new module to nginx, you need to recompile nginx.

```bash
cd /usr/local/src
wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.18.0.tar.gz
tar -zxf nginx-1.18.0.tar.gz
```
> It is recommended to use nginx-1.18.0, otherwise this module may not work normally.

### download the source code of ngx_waf

```bash
cd /usr/local/src
git clone https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf.git
cd ngx_waf
git clone -b v2.1.0 https://github.com/troydhanson/uthash.git inc/uthash
```

### compile

```bash
cd /usr/local/src/nginx-1.18.0
./configure xxx --add-module=/usr/local/src/ngx_waf
make
```
> If you have already installed nginx, it is recommended to run `nginx -V` to get the compilation parameters, and then replace `xxx` with it.

### install

If you have installed nginx, you can directly replace the binary file (assuming the full path of the original binary file is `/usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx`).

```bash
nginx -s stop
mv /usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx /usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx.old
cp objs/nginx /usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx
nginx
```

> If you don’t want to stop the nginx service, you can upgrade through hot deployment, see [Official Document](https://nginx.org/en/docs/control.html) for hot deployment method.

***

If nginx is not installed.

```bash
make install
```

## How to use?

You should edit nginx.conf as follow.

```text
http {
    ...
    server {
        ...
        waf on;
        waf_rule_path /usr/local/src/ngx_waf/rules/;
        waf_mult_mount off;
        waf_cc_deny on;
        waf_cc_deny_limit 1000 60;
        ...
    }
    ...
}

```
### `waf`

### `waf_cc_deny`

+ syntax: `waf_cc_deny [ on | off ];`
+ default: `off`
+ context: server

Whether to enable 'Anti Challenge Collapsar'.

### `waf_cc_deny_limit`

+ syntax: `waf_cc_deny_limit rate duration;`
+ default: 无
+ context: server

Declare the maximum request rate of the same IP and the blocking time after the rate is exceeded.

`rate`: The maximum number of requests per minute for the same IP.
`duration`: The number of minutes to block after exceeding the `rate`.


### test

```text
https://example.com/www.bak
```

If the http status code is 403, it means this module is working normally.

### Rule file

All regular expressions follow the [PCRE Standard](http://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2syntax.html).

The effective order of rule files (from top to bottom, the priority gradually decreases):

+ rules/white-ipv4：IPV4 whitelist, each rule has its own line. Each line can only be an IPV4 address or a CIDR address block. Allow matched IPV4 address.
+ rules/ipv4：IPV4 blacklist, each rule has its own line. Each line can only be an IPV4 address or a CIDR address block. Block the matched IPV4 address and return 403.
+ rules/white-url：URL whitelist, each rule has its own line. One regular expression per line, when the URL is matched by any rule, it will be allowed.
+ rules/url：URL blacklist, each rule has its own line. There is a regular expression per line, and 403 is returned when the URL is matched by any rule.
+ rules/args：Request args blacklist, each rule has its own line. There is one regular expression per line, and 403 is returned when the request args is matched by any rule.
+ rules/user-agent：UserAgent blacklist, each rule has its own line. There is one regular expression per line, and 403 is returned when the user-agent is matched by any rule.
+ rules/white-referer：Referer whitelist, each rule has its own line. One regular expression per line, when the referer is matched by any rule, it will be allowed.
+ rules/referer：Referer blacklist, each rule has its own line. There is a regular expression per line, and 403 is returned when the referer is matched by any rule.
+ rules/cookie：Cookie blacklist, each rule has its own line. There is a regular expression per line, and 403 is returned when the cookie is matched by any rule.
+ rules/post：Request body blacklist, each rule has its own line. There is a regular expression per line, and 403 is returned when the request body is matched by any rule.


### Variable

When writing `nginx.conf`, some variables are inevitably needed. For example, `$remote_addr` can be used to get the client IP address.

This module adds three available variables.

+ `$waf_blocked`: Whether this request is intercepted by this module, if intercepted, its value is `'true'`, otherwise it is `'false'`.
+ `$waf_rule_type`：If this request is block by this module, its value is the triggered rule type. The following are possible values. If not block , its value is `'null'`.
    + `'BLACK-IPV4'`
    + `'BLACK-URL'`
    + `'BLACK-ARGS'`
    + `'BLACK-USER-AGENT'`
    + `'BLACK-REFERER'`
    + `'BLACK-COOKIE'`
    + `'BLACK-POST'`
+ `'$waf_rule_details'`：If this request is blocked by this module, its value is the content of the specific rule triggered. If it is not blocked, its value is `'null'`.

## Log

The block log is stored in `error.log`. The log level of the block record is ALERT. The basic format is `xxxxx, ngx_waf: [Type][Rule], xxxxx`, see the following example for details.

```text
2020/01/20 22:56:30 [alert] 24289#0: *30 ngx_waf: [BLACK-URL][(?i)(?:/\.env$)], client: 192.168.1.1, server: example.com, request: "GET /v1/.env HTTP/1.1", host: "example.com", referrer: "http:/example.com/v1/.env"

2020/01/20 22:58:40 [alert] 24678#0: *11 ngx_waf: [BLACK-POST][(?i)(?:select.+(?:from|limit))], client: 192.168.1.1, server: example.com, request: "POST /xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1", host: "example.com", referrer: "https://example.com/"
```

## FAQ

### Why does the request speed slow down for a while?

It may be because the 'Anti Challenge Collapsar' is enabled, see[Performance-Memory Management](#性能-内存管理)for details.

### Why not check the request body?

For performance reasons, this module will check whether it is in the memory before checking the request body. If it is, it will check normally, otherwise skip the check. You can try to edit `nginx.conf`

```text
http {
    ...
    # https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_body_buffer_size
    client_body_buffer_size: 10M;
    # https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_body_in_file_only
    client_body_in_file_only: off;
    ...
}
```

### fork() failed while spawning "worker process" (12: Cannot allocate memory)

It may be caused by frequent run  `nginx -s reload`. This module will allocate some memory when reading the `nginx.conf`, but some memory will not be released immediately after run `nginx -s reload`, so it is frequently` nginx -s reload` is very likely to cause this error.

You can kill all of nginx‘s processes and restart nginx.

## Performance

### Memory management

<span id='性能-内存管理'></span>

When the 'Anti Challenge Collapsar' enabled, this module will free some memory periodically and allocate some memory once, but it will not free all at once, but gradually free. Each request will release a small part of the memory until all the memory is free. Slow down processing time slightly.
