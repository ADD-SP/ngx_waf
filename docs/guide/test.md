# Test

## Quick Test

Visit `/www.bak` and if a 403 status code is returned, the module is successfully started.

## Performance Test

### Example Test

#### Test Description

* Approximately 210,000 IPV4 whitelist rules were used.
* About 210,000 IPV4 blacklist rules were used.
* Approximately 48,000 IPV6 whitelist rules were used.
* Approximately 48,000 IPV6 blacklist rules were used.
* 100,000 URL blacklist rules used, obtained by random string generator.
* 100,000 URL whitelist rules were used, obtained by a random string generator.
* Uses 5000 random strings, obtained by a random string generator. One of them is randomly selected as the URI for each request to send a GET request.
* The test lasts 30 minutes.
* Tested twice, once with the firewall on and once with the firewall off.

Configuration used for testing.

```nginx
master_process on;
worker_processes  1;

http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name  localhost;

        access_log off;
        
        waf on;
        waf_mode DYNAMIC !CC !POST;
        waf_rule_path /usr/local/src/ngx_waf/rules/;
        waf_cache capacity=6000 interval=1h percent=50;

        location / {
            default_type text/html;
            return 200 'hello';
        }
    }
}
```

#### Test Command

```sh
wrk -c 100 -d 30m -t 1 -s test/wrk/rand.lua --latency http://localhost/ -- /path/to/rand-str.txt
```

#### Test Results

With the firewall on, QPS is reduced by about 4%.

```sh
# waf on;
wrk -c 100 -d 30m -t 1 -s ngx_waf/test/wrk/rand.lua --timeout 1m --latency http://localhost/ -- /usr/local/src/ngx_waf/txt.txt

### Test By Yourself

You can use [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk) to perform performance tests on this module.

The project provides a lua script for wrk to assist in the testing. The script has the path `test/wrk/rand.lua` and functions by sending GET requests with a random URI. You need to provide it with a text file containing a certain number of random strings, one random string per line. Then test it with the following command.

```sh
wrk -c 100 -d 1m -t 1 -s test/wrk/rand.lua --latency http://localhost/ -- /path/to/rand-str.txt
```
