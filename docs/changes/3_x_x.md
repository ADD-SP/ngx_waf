***

## [3.0.0] - 2020-12-25

### Added

* Anti Challenge Collapsar now supports IPV6 ([00fbc1c](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/00fbc1c20ec964f6cd3bb992d756737e95b6c7ed)).

Warnings or error reporting when IP addresses in the rule file are invalid or IP address blocks overlap (does not detect all overlaps).

* Faster IP matching ([2b9e774](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/2b9e77404826666df301c3d6b3ce07a6968de266)).

* Fixed a bug that caused the cookie inspection not work ([87beed1](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/87beed183e404c70411a2d35ea68ebbccccf5ff6)).

* Modify the `config` file to ensure that the latest module code is compiled when executing `make` or `make modules` ([25f97f5](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/25f97f5e7f3792b131ab0ebb1bfe4b7fe5e330ae)). Before the fix, if only the files under `inc/` changed, the latest code would not be compiled because the files under `inc/` were not checked for changes.

* Fixed a bug with incorrect IPV4 segment identification ([73a22eb](https://github.com/ADD-SP/ngx_waf/commit/73a22eb3538a24e9714bf8331946a5654df20cc1)). This bug could cause the subnet mask not to be generated correctly when a rule like `192.168.0.0/10`, i.e. the suffix is not a multiple of 8, appears in the rule.
